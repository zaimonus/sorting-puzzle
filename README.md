# sorting-puzzle
I was bored and made the sorting game i saw in some ads recently

## Pull requests or Forks
This project is actually not worth uploading to github, but maybe newbies want to improve the game a bit and maybe learn how forks or pull requests work

## Ideas:
- replace/rename the grid class to make it resemble a column manager
- split the game into logic and ui (gui or cli) components
